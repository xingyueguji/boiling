run_boiling.C  :  main target boiling analysis code which reads
                  raw ROOTfiles and produces an output summary file
		  with the relevant information



Output Summary Files with the normalized yield
(and other relevant info)
----------------------------------------------------
hms_Al_yield.data
hms_C12_yield.data
hms_LH2_yield.data
hms_LD2_yield.data


make_plot.py   :  python code that reads in the output summary files
                  and makes the relevant plots.

#  This info below can be found in each of the summary files.
#
#  NOTE: ALL VARIABLES HAVE A BCM CURRENT CUT OF +/- 3 uA about the set current
#  Relevant Headers:
#
#  set_current:    central beam current [uA]
#
#  avg_current_bcm4a (or b):  average beam current
#  (calculated using a beam current cut of +/- 3 uA about the set_current) 
#
#  Qtot_bcm4a : BCM4A total charge [mC]
#
#  sclY4a, sclY_err4a: scaler normalized yield for bcm4a (same applied for BCM4B)
#  --> scaler yield was calculated by counting EDTM-subtracted htrig2 scalers and dividing by the total charge
#
#  ntrkY4a, ntrkY_err4a: non-tracking normalized yield for bcm4a (same applies for BCM4B)
#  --> non-tracking yield was calculated by integrating over HMS calorimeter variable H.cal.etotnorm with cuts: hcer_npeSum>0.7 && hcal_etotnorm>0.7
#  --> the yield was then divided by: total bcm4a charge (Qtot_bcm4a) and computer live time (cpuLT_bcm4a)
#  
#  trkY4a, trkY_err4a: tracking normalized yield for bcm4a  (same applies for BCM4B)
#  --> tracking yield was calculated by integrating over HMS delta (H.gtr.dp) with cuts: h_calEtotTrackNorm > 0.7 && abs(h_delta) < 8.0
#  --> the yield was then divided by: total bcm4a charge (Qtot_bcm4a), computer live time (cpuLT_bcm4a) and electron tracking efficiency (h_eTrkEff_bcm4a)
#
#  electron tracking effifiency definition:  
#  good_elec_should = hGoodScinHit==1.&&hBetanotrk>0.85&&hBetanotrk<1.5&&hCAL_etotnorm>0.6&&hCER_npeSum>0.7;
#  good_elec_did = good_elec_should&&hdc_ntrack>0.;
#
#  ALL ABOVE-MENTIONED HISTOGRAMS WHERE INTEGRATED FOR ALL EVENTS THAT ACTUALLY PASSED THE BCM CUT
